            <h4>The September 2015 Night Sky</h4>
            <p>By <a href=#>ADMIN</a> _September 3, 2015.</p>
            <p class="data">To start off the month we have our best view of Neptune, the furthest planet away from us in our solar system. On 1st September Neptune will be at opposition to the Sun, so its face will be illuminated by our local star, and will be visible in the night sky. To the naked eye it will not even be visible in the sky as it is so far away from the Earth. If you have a powerful telescope however, you will be able to see it in a bit more detail but still just as looking like a faint blue dot and not in its impressive glory. Neptune is the eighth planet in our solar system and its existence was discovered by Urbain Le Verrier , a brilliant (but allegedly rather “difficult”) French mathematician who specialised in celestial mechanics, in 1846. He was able to predict the existence of the planet Neptune using only mathematics.</p>

            <h4>The Truth about the 'Blood Moon tetrad'</h4>
            <p>By <a href=#>ADMIN</a> _August 18, 2015.</p>
            <p class="data">Some you may wonder why this happens. When in the full umbra of the Earth you would think the Moon would be black or even invisible, and this would be the case if the Earth had no atmosphere, but thankfully for us it does and here is the real beauty of the lunar event. When sunlight reaches the Earth the atmosphere filters out the various colours in the spectrum of light, which is the same way in which the sky appears blue. The red colour of the light spectrum is first bent towards the Earth as it enters the atmosphere and then bent again as it is exiting the atmosphere. This may sound quite confusing but it is a process called Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
